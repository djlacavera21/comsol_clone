# COMSOL Clone

A free software version of COMSOL MultiPhysics Simulator.

## Overview

COMSOL Clone is a multiphysics simulation tool that allows users to perform various types of physics simulations, including Poisson's equation, elasticity, and heat transfer problems. This project aims to provide an open-source alternative to COMSOL MultiPhysics.

## Features

- **Poisson's Equation**: Solve Poisson's equation in 2D.
- **Structural Mechanics**: Perform elasticity analysis for 2D structures.
- **Heat Transfer**: Simulate heat conduction in 2D.

## Installation

To install the COMSOL Clone, you need Python 3.6 or higher. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib PyQt5
